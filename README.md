# Clicker iOS Client 

Clicker is another app from [CUAppDev](http://cuappdev.org), a project team at Cornell University. It is an app that seeks to extend the functionality of iClickers on a web and mobile platform.

## Development
### Installation
We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for our dependency manager. This should be installed before continuing.

After cloning the project, `cd` into the new directory and install dependencies with
```
pod install
```
Open the Clicker Xcode workspace, `Clicker.xcworkspace`, and enjoy!
